# TapAndGo
Create class that simulate Tap and Go card payments.  Your class should have a pay method that takes in the amount you would like to pay for.  You class should have a deposit method for you to put money onto the card. And a getBalance method to show how much money is on the card.  Use a constructor to to pass in the Tap And Go threshold if the payment amount is bigger than that amount the pay method should throw an exception and do nothing else (the balance should stay unaffected).  If your card don't have enough money on it payment should also fail and the method should throw an exception. The balance should stay unaffected if you don't have enough money.  Create 2 classes one with a main method that is calling the Tap Card (payment) class.
